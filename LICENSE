FREETYPE LICENSES
-----------------

The FreeType  2 font  engine is  copyrighted work  and cannot  be used
legally without  a software  license.  In order  to make  this project
usable to  a vast majority of  developers, we distribute it  under two
mutually exclusive open-source licenses.

This means that *you* must choose  *one* of the two licenses described
below, then obey all its terms and conditions when using FreeType 2 in
any of your projects or products.

  - The FreeType License,  found in the file  `docs/FTL.TXT`, which is
    similar to the  original BSD license *with*  an advertising clause
    that forces  you to explicitly  cite the FreeType project  in your
    product's  documentation.  All  details are  in the  license file.
    This license is suited to products which don't use the GNU General
    Public License.

    Note that  this license  is compatible to  the GNU  General Public
    License version 3, but not version 2.

  - The   GNU   General   Public   License   version   2,   found   in
    `docs/GPLv2.TXT`  (any  later  version  can  be  used  also),  for
    programs  which  already  use  the  GPL.  Note  that  the  FTL  is
    incompatible with GPLv2 due to its advertisement clause.

The contributed  BDF and PCF  drivers come  with a license  similar to
that  of the  X Window  System.   It is  compatible to  the above  two
licenses (see files `src/bdf/README`  and `src/pcf/README`).  The same
holds   for   the   source    code   files   `src/base/fthash.c`   and
`include/freetype/internal/fthash.h`; they wer part  of the BDF driver
in earlier FreeType versions.

The gzip  module uses the  zlib license (see  `src/gzip/zlib.h`) which
too is compatible to the above two licenses.

The  MD5 checksum  support  (only used  for  debugging in  development
builds) is in the public domain.

This is a library for the Adafruit ILI9341 display products

This library works with the Adafruit 2.8" Touch Shield V2 (SPI) ----> http://www.adafruit.com/products/1651

Check out the links above for our tutorials and wiring diagrams. These displays use SPI to communicate, 4 or 5 pins are required to interface (RST is optional).

Adafruit invests time and resources providing this open source code, please support Adafruit and open-source hardware by purchasing products from Adafruit!

The original starting point for this library was the Adafruit_ILI9341
library in January 2015.

The licence for that library is MIT.

The first evolution of the library that led to TFT_eSPI is recorded here:

Selected functions from the Adafruit_GFX library (as it was in 2015) have
been imported into the TFT_eSPI.cpp file and modified to improve
performance, add features and make them compatible with the ESP8266 and
ESP32.

The fonts from the Adafruit_GFX and Button functions were added later.
The fonts can be found with the license.txt file in the "Fonts\GFXFF"
folder.

The Adafruit_GFX functions are covered by the BSD licence.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^End^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Due to the evolution of the TFT_eSPI library the original code may no longer
be recognisable, however in most cases the function names can be used as a
reference point since the aim is to retain a level of compatibility with
the popular Adafruit_GFX graphics functions.

Contributions from other authors are recorded on GitHub:
https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT_eSPI

The major addition to the original library was the addition of fast
rendering proportional fonts of different sizes as documented here:

https://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-TFT-display-and-font-library/

The larger fonts are "Run Length Encoded (RLE)", this was done to
reduce the font memory footprint for AVR processors that have limited
FLASH, with the added benefit of a significant improvement in rendering
speed.

In 2016 the library evolved significantly to support the ESP8266 and then
the ESP32. In 2017 new Touch Screen functions were added and a new Sprite
class called TFT_eSprite to permit "flicker free" screen updates of complex
graphics.

In 2018 anti-aliased fonts were added along with a Processing font conversion
sketch.

In 2019 the library was adapted to be able to use it with any 32 bit Arduino
compatible processor. It will run on 8 bit and 16 bit processors but will be
slow due to extensive use of 32 bit varaibles.

Many of the example sketches are original work, that contain code created
for my own projects. For all the original code the FreeBSD licence applies
and is compatible with the GNU GPL.
